	Recently, there has been so great advances in using neural networks are general function approximators. They have been used successfully in Q-Learning to approximate the \textit{action-values} and the \textit{policy}. This this report I describe many of the steps involved in building a string RL framework based off of neural network using Deep Learning. The report includes example code in Python using the Theano library.
