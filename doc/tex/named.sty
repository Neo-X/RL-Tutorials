% This file implements citations for the ``named'' bibliography style.
%  Place it in a file called named.sty in the TeX search path.  (Placing it
% in the same directory as the LaTeX document should also work.)
 
% Prepared by Peter F. Patel-Schneider, with the assistance of several,
% since forgotten, LaTeX hackers.
% This style is NOT guaranteed to work.  It is provided in the hope
% that it will make the preparation of papers easier.
%
% There are undoubtably bugs in this style.  If you make bug fixes,
% improvements, etc.  please let me know.  My e-mail address is:
%       pfps@research.att.com
 
% The preparation of this file was supported by Schlumberger Palo Alto
% Research and AT\&T Bell Laboratories.
 
% This file can be modified and used in other conferences as long
% as credit to the authors and supporting agencies is retained, this notice
% is not changed, and further modification or reuse is not restricted.
 
% The ``named'' bibliography style creates citations with labels like
%       \citeauthoryear{author-info}{year}
% these labels are processed by the following commands:
%       \cite{key}
%               which produces citations with both author and year,
%               enclosed in square brackets
%       \shortcite{key}
%               which produces citations with year only,
%               enclosed in square brackets
%       \citeauthor{key}
%               which produces the author information only
%       \citeyear{key}
%               which produces the year information only
