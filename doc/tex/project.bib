abstract={Autonomous learning has been a promising direction in control and robotics for more than a decade since data-driven learning allows to reduce the amount of engineering knowledge, which is otherwise required. However, autonomous reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically require many interactions with the system to learn controllers, which is a practical limitation in real systems, such as robots, where many interactions can be impractical and time consuming. To address this problem, current learning approaches typically require task-specific knowledge in form of expert demonstrations, realistic simulators, pre-shaped policies, or specific knowledge about the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we follow a different approach and speed up learning by extracting more information from data. In particular, we learn a probabilistic, non-parametric Gaussian process transition model of the system. By explicitly incorporating model uncertainty into long-term planning and controller learning our approach reduces the effects of model errors, a key problem in model-based learning. Compared to state-of-the art RL our model-based policy search method achieves an unprecedented speed of learning. We demonstrate its applicability to autonomous learning in real robot and control tasks.},

     abstract = {It has been argued that brachiation is an energetically cheap way to move since, like a swinging pendulum, it involves an alternate storage and recovery of kinetic energy in gravitational potential energy during each swing. Walking also involves an alternate storage and recovery of kinetic energy in gravitational potential energy during a stride, and it has been likened to an inverted pendulum. There seems no a priori reason to suppose that the suspended pendulum of the "brachiator" is an energetically cheaper mechanism for locomotion than the inverted pendulum of the "walker." We therefore measured the energetic cost of locomotion as a function of speed as spider monkeys brachiated on a rope mill and on a horizontal ladder mill and as they walked on a treadmill. We compared the energetic cost of brachiation, the most specialized form of suspended locomotion, with that of the simplest-upside-down walking in the loris. We found that spider monkeys used significantly more energy to move at any speed when they brachiated than when they walked. The lorises, on the other hand, used the same amount of energy whether they moved upright or suspended beneath a rope. Although brachiation requires more energy to move a given distance, it may allow animals to drastically reduce the distance per trip in an arboreal habitat by moving from branch to branch in the periphery of trees.},

To understand this impressive performance, we recorded leaps of the gibbons exceeding 3.7 m. Gibbons perform more mass-specific work (35.4 J kg-1) than reported for any other species to date, accelerating to 8.3 ms-1 in a single movement and redefining our estimates of work performance by animals.

This is the first captive study of the kinematics of brachiation in Lagothrix. Videorecordings of one adult male of each species were made in a specially designed cage constructed at the DuMond Conservancy/Monkey Jungle, Miami, FL. Java software (Jandel Scientific Inc., San Rafael, CA) was used for frame-by-frame kinematic analysis of individual strides/steps. Results demonstrate that the sequence of hand and tail contacts differ significantly between the two species with Lagothrix using a new tail hold with every hand hold, while Ateles generally utilizes a new tail hold with only every other hand hold. Stride length and stride frequency, even after adjusting for limb length, also differ significantly between the two species. Lagothrix brachiation utilizes short, choppy strides with quick hand holds, while Ateles uses long, fluid strides with longer hand holds. During brachiation not only is Lagothrix's body significantly less horizontal than that of Ateles but also, within Ateles, there are significant differences between steps depending on tail use. Because of the unique nature of tail use in Ateles, many aspects of body positioning in Lagothrix more closely resemble Ateles steps without a simultaneous tail hold rather than those with one. Overall pendulum length in Lagothrix is shorter than in Ateles. Tail use in Ateles has a significant effect on maximum pendulum length during a step. Although neither species achieves the extreme pendulum effect and long period of free-flight of hylobatids in fast ricochetal brachiation, in captivity both consistently demonstrate effective brachiation with brief periods of free-flight and pendular motion. Morphological similarities between ateline brachiators and hylobatids are fewer and less pronounced in Lagothrix than in Ateles. This study demonstrates that Lagothrix brachiation is also less hylobatid-like than that of Ateles. Am. J. Primatol. 48:263–281, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

The older literature and its conclusions are evaluated against recent work performed by the author and other research groups working on brachiation models, either computer simulations or physical robots. The gibbon displays two types of brachiation: continuous contact, analogous to walking, and ricochetal, analogous to running. Both brachiation gaits display substantial pendular exchange between kinetic and potential energy. However, the fundamental feature of either of these gaits is the minimization of collisional energy loss. Collisional energy loss due to discontinuities in the trajectory of the center of mass is emerging as key in understanding locomotion using limbs in any terrestrial environment. The insight gained from this perspective applied to gibbon locomotion demonstrates that this is a critical factor in understanding many of the maneuvers employed by these animals, and can provide novel new interpretations of the morphological specializations that characterize the group. It is observed that these animals could brachiate using either totally active (muscle powered) or totally passive (nonmuscular) mechanisms. The active option would be metabolically costly, but provides substantial motion plasticity, while the passive option has the potential for profound economy, but does not allow a means to effectively contend with the inconsistencies present in the animal's natural environment. The conclusion is that the body form of brachiators and the locomotion behaviors they exhibit are a compromise between these two extremes, and these features of the gibbon's biology can only be understood by recognizing the role of collisional enerlgy loss and evaluating both passive and active motion options together.

abstract = {How do arm-swinging apes locomote effectively over a variety of speeds? One way to reduce the metabolic energy cost of locomotion is to transfer energy between reversible mechanical modes. In terrestrial animals, at least two transfer mechanisms have been identified: 1) a pendulum-like mechanism for walking, with exchange between gravitational potential energy and translational kinetic energy, and 2) a spring-like mechanism for running, where the elastic strain energy of stretched muscle and tendon is largely returned to reaccelerate the animal. At slower speeds, a brachiator will always have at least one limb in contact with the support, similar to the overlap of foot contact in bipedal walking. At faster speeds, brachiators exhibit an aerial phase, similar to that seen in bipedal running. Are there two distinct brachiation gaits even though the animal appears to simply swing beneath its overhead support? If so, are different exchange mechanisms employed? Our kinetic analysis of brachiation in a white-handed gibbon (Hylobates lar) indicates that brachiation is indeed comprised of two mechanically distinct gaits. At slower speeds in “continuous contact” brachiation, the gibbon utilizes a simple pendulum-like transfer of mechanical energy within each stride. At faster speeds in “ricochetal” brachiation, translational and rotational kinetic energy are exchanged in a novel “whip-like” transfer. We propose that brachiators utilize the transfer between translational and rotational kinetic energy to control the dynamics of their swing. This maneuver may allow muscle action at the shoulder to control the transfer and adjust the ballistic portion of the step to meet the requirements for the next hand contact.

abstract ={Gibbons are able to brachiate effectively through the forest canopy with a
suspended swinging motion via contact with handholds. The swing phase
is unlikely to be a cause of significant energy loss as pendulums are able to
oscillate with only gradual mechanical energy dissipation. We consider the
energetics associated with the transition of either a swing (during
continuous-contact brachiation) or a ballistic flight (ricochetal brachiation)
to a subsequent swing. In both styles of brachiation, kinematic data suggest
that a gibbon overshoots the path that would allow a smooth transition into
the swing phase. The sudden change in velocity due to such an overshoot is
associated with a collision. Assuming neither the handhold nor the gibbon
stores elastic strain energy, the energetic consequences of such overshoots
can be calculated.We suggest two reasons for overshooting smooth transition trajectories: in
the case of continuous contact brachiation, excess mechanical energy can be
maintained with a high amplitude swing, and an overshoot during ricochetal
brachiation produces a safety margin.The degree of energy loss with the transition to the swing phase is
dependent both on the alignment of the pre- and post-transition paths, and on
the kinetic energy at that instant. Active mechanisms reduce the effects of
overshoots in both brachiation gaits. During continuous-contact brachiation,
the path of the centre of mass can be controlled actively by flexion both of
the trailing arm and the legs. During ricochetal brachiation, the length
between the hand and the centre of mass (determining the subsequent swing
path) can be controlled throughout the flight phase with leg
flexion/extension. In addition, the elongated arms characteristic of gibbons
improves the geometry of a collision for a given overshoot, and so may be
viewed as a morphological adaptation reducing the energetic losses caused by
overshooting for safety.},

abstract ={In brachiation, an animal uses alternating bimanual support to move beneath an overhead support. Past brachiation models have been based on the oscillations of a simple pendulum over half of a full cycle of oscillation. These models have been unsatisfying because the natural behavior of gibbons and siamangs appears to be far less restricted than so predicted. Cursorial mammals use an inverted pendulum-like energy exchange in walking, but switch to a spring-based energy exchange in running as velocity increases. Brachiating apes do not possess the anatomical springs characteristic of the limbs of terrestrial runners and do not appear to be using a spring-based gait. How do these animals move so easily within the branches of the forest canopy? Are there fundamental mechanical factors responsible for the transition from a continuous-contact gait where at least one hand is on a hand hold at a time, to a ricochetal gait where the animal vaults between hand holds? We present a simple model of ricochetal locomotion based on a combination of parabolic free flight and simple circular pendulum motion of a single point mass on a massless arm. In this simple brachiation model, energy losses due to inelastic collisions of the animal with the support are avoided, either because the collisions occur at zero velocity (continuous-contact brachiation) or by a smooth matching of the circular and parabolic trajectories at the point of contact (ricochetal brachiation). This model predicts that brachiation is possible over a large range of speeds, handhold spacings and gait frequencies with (theoretically) no mechanical energy cost. We then add the further assumption that a brachiator minimizes either its total energy or, equivalently, its peak arm tension, or a peak tension-related measure of muscle contraction metabolic cost. However, near the optimum the model is still rather unrestrictive. We present some comparisons with gibbon brachiation showing that the simple dynamic model presented has predictive value. However, natural gibbon motion is even smoother than the smoothest motions predicted by this primitive model.},

abstract={Planning the path of an autonomous, agile vehicle in a dynamic environment is a very complex problem, especially when the vehicle is required to use its full maneuvering capabilities. Recent efforts aimed at using randomized algorithms for planning the path of kinematic and dynamic vehicles have demonstrated considerable potential for implementation on future autonomous platforms. This paper builds upon these efforts by proposing a randomized motion planning architecture for dynamical systems in the presence of fixed and moving obstacles. This architecture addresses the dynamic constraints on the vehicle's motion, and it provides at the same time a consistent decoupling between low-level control and motion planning. Simulation examples involving a ground robot and a small autonomous helicopter, are presented and discussed},

abstract ={This paper presents the first randomized approach to kinodynamic planning (also known                 as trajectory planning or trajectory design). The task is to determine control                 inputs to drive a robot from an ini ial configuration and velocity to a goal                 configuration and velocity while obeying physically based dynamical models and                 avoiding obstacles in the robot’s environment. The authors consider                 generic systems that express the nonlinear dynamics of a robot in terms of the                 robot’s high-dimensional configuration space. Kinodynamic planning is                 treated as a motion-planning problem in a higher dimensional state space that has                 both first-order differential constraints and obstacle-based global constraints. The                 state space serves the same role as the configuration space for basic path planning;                 however, standard randomized path-planning techniques do not directly apply to                 planning trajectories in the state space. The authors have developed a randomized                 planning approach that is particularly tailored to trajectory planning problems in                 high-dimensional state spaces. The basis for this approach is the construction of                 rapidly exploring random trees, which offer benefits that are similar to those                 obtained by successful randomized holonomic planning methods but apply to a much                 broader class of problems. Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is given.                 Experimental results are presented for an implementation that computes trajectories                 for hovercrafts and satellites in cluttered environments, resulting in state spaces                 of up to 12 dimensions.},

Due to the NP-Hardness of the MP problem, heuristic methods have outperformed the classic approaches and have gained wide popularity. After surveying around 1400 papers in the field, the amount of existing works for each method is identified and classified. Especially, the history and applications of numerous heuristic methods in MP is investigated. The paper concludes with comparative tables and graphs demonstrating the frequency of each MP method's application, and so can be used as a guideline for MP researchers. },

abstract ={
               During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as probabilistic roadmaps (PRM) and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g. as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g. showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e. such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.

The method works by incrementally building two rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) rooted at the start and the goal configurations. The trees each explore space around them and also advance towards each other through, the use of a simple greedy heuristic. Although originally designed to plan motions for a human arm (modeled as a 7-DOF kinematic chain) for the automatic graphic animation of collision-free grasping and manipulation tasks, the algorithm has been successfully applied to a variety of path planning problems. Computed examples include generating collision-free motions for rigid objects in 2D and 3D, and collision-free manipulation motions for a 6-DOF PUMA arm in a 3D workspace.

%%%%%%%%%% Brachiation examples %%%%%%%%%%%%

@article{1534484020041101,
Abstract = {In this paper, we present a control method to realize smooth continuous brachiation. The target brachiation is basically divided into two actions: a swing action and a locomotion action. In order to realize the continuous brachiation effectively and smoothly, it is necessary to start the swing action as soon as the robot grasps the front target bar at the end of the locomotion action. The collision, which occurs at the moment the robot grips the target bar, affects the pendulum motion of the robot. The action of bending the elbow joint of the swinging arm is proposed in order to solve this gripping problem. The elbow-bending action enables the robot to decrease the impact forces and use the excess mechanical energy after the end of the locomotion phase. Thus, there is no loss of energy and waste of time during the subsequent swing phase. Experimental results show that the robot can successfully achieve smooth, continuous brachiation.

abstract={This paper deals with a new type of mobile robot, the brachiation robot, that makes use of the swing of a pendulum due to gravity, showing a simulation method with some results of its continuous mode during one period from the initial static condition to compute one cycle of the transfer motion. This type of robot can make use of energy stored by swing, thus can move with little energy induced. The problem in this study is to show the simulation method for the discontinuous motion, since the brachiation motion involves the switching of the swing supporting arms as a monkey does in the branch transfer motion. This paper shows a computational method of this discontinuous motion and also the energy evaluation in the brachiation motions, after introducing a new mobile mechanism. Then it becomes possible to evaluate such an oscillation effect during a period of brachiation motion, including the motion behavior and consumed energy depending on motion modes. Thus, this paper gives some insights for designing the structure and control method of a new brachiation type of robot.<>},

title={A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II},
year={2002},
volume={6},
number={2},
pages={182-197},
abstract={Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN3) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN2) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},
